# Flutter Customer App - Null Safety Fixes

## Problem
The customer app was showing red error screens with "Null check operator used on a null value" errors when trying to access vendor screens and categories, specifically when viewing "Fresh Produce" and other vendor types.

## Root Cause
Multiple null check operators (!) were being used unsafely throughout the codebase without proper null safety checks, causing runtime crashes when data was unexpectedly null.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. VendorTypeCategories Widget (`Customer/lib/widgets/vendor_type_categories.view.dart`)
- **Fixed unsafe null check operators in title and description text building (lines 96-98 and 105-107)**
- **Before:** `(widget.title != null ? widget.title : "We are here for you")!`
- **After:** `(widget.title ?? "We are here for you")`
- Added comprehensive null safety checks for vendorType throughout the widget
- Added fallback UI when vendorType is null

### 2. CategoriesViewModel (`Customer/lib/view_models/vendor/categories.vm.dart`)
- Added null safety checks for vendorType.id before making API calls
- Improved error handling when vendorType is null
- Added detailed logging for debugging

### 3. VendorDetailsWithMenuViewModel (`Customer/lib/view_models/vendor_menu_details.vm.dart`)
- **Fixed multiple unsafe null check operators on vendor object**
- Added null safety checks in:
  - `getVendorDetails()` method
  - `updateUiComponents()` method
  - `uploadPrescription()` method
  - `loadMenuProducts()` method
  - `loadMoreProducts()` method
  - `openVendorSearch()` method
- Replaced dangerous `!` operators with proper null checks and safe alternatives

## Key Changes Summary
- Replaced `object!.property` with null-safe alternatives like `object?.property ?? defaultValue`
- Added comprehensive null checks before accessing object properties
- Implemented fallback behaviors when objects are null
- Added better error messages and logging for debugging

## Testing Instructions
1. Clean and rebuild the Flutter app:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk
   ```

2. Test the following scenarios:
   - Navigate to vendor categories (like "Fresh Produce")
   - Try to access different vendor types
   - Open vendor details pages
   - Search within vendors
   - Upload prescriptions (if pharmacy type)

3. Check logs for any remaining null safety issues

## Files Modified
- `Customer/lib/widgets/vendor_type_categories.view.dart`
- `Customer/lib/view_models/vendor/categories.vm.dart`  
- `Customer/lib/view_models/vendor_menu_details.vm.dart`

## Expected Result
- No more red error screens when accessing vendor categories
- Graceful handling of null data with appropriate fallbacks
- Improved app stability and user experience
- Better error messages for debugging if issues persist

## Notes
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- All changes are defensive programming practices
- No functionality was removed, only made safer
- Additional logging was added for easier debugging
