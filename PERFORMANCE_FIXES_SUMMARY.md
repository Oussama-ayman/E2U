# Performance Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Google Maps API Errors
**Problem**: Repeated "API project not found" errors from Google Maps geocoding API
**Fix**: 
- Added error handling in location service to prevent repeated failed API calls
- Added fallback mechanism to return basic address information when geocoding fails
- Added cooldown mechanism in HTTP service to prevent frequent geocoding requests

### 2. Slow Order API Response
**Problem**: Order placement API taking 6+ seconds
**Fix**: 
- This is likely a server-side issue, but we've implemented proper timeout handling (30 seconds)
- Added performance monitoring to identify slow APIs
- Implemented caching mechanisms to reduce unnecessary calls

### 3. Redundant Geocoding Requests
**Problem**: Multiple unnecessary geocoding requests throughout the app lifecycle
**Fix**:
- Added 1-minute cooldown period for geocoding requests
- Improved header caching to reduce redundant operations
- Better error handling to prevent repeated failed calls

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Timeout Configuration**: All HTTP requests now have proper timeouts (30 seconds each)
2. **Header Caching**: Headers are cached for 5 minutes to avoid repeated heavy operations
3. **Location Services Optimization**: 
   - Using `getLastKnownPosition()` for faster location retrieval
   - Added cooldown mechanism to prevent frequent geocoding
   - Better error handling for failed geocoding attempts
4. **Network Performance Monitoring**: Added logging for slow API calls
5. **Improved Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures without crashing the app

## Benefits

- Reduced battery drain from repeated location services calls
- Faster app response times due to header caching
- Better user experience with proper timeout handling
- More reliable operation even when external APIs fail
- Reduced network traffic from unnecessary repeated requests

These fixes should significantly improve the app's performance and reliability, especially in scenarios with poor network connectivity or when external services are temporarily unavailable.
